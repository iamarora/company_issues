### YourStake Fullstack Engineer Take Home 2021

Please try not to spend more than 3 hours on this, if you find yourself stuck on any specific part just finish the rest
and make a note in your readme.

### Description

YourStake is a platform for helping people learn more about the impact of their investments. We're always looking for
new ways to help our users explore the data in our system. We deal with lots of different datasets covering thousands
of companies from all sorts of sources.

For this task we've generated a list of 2500 (fake) companies and whether their business is involved in any of four
areas that many people care about: Animal Testing, Nuclear Weapons, Coal Power, or Rainforest Destruction. This data is
in `company_exclusions.csv`. We want to set up a public page where any visitor to our website can explore some of this
new data and see if companies that they are invested in are involved in any of these issues.

### Requirements

- Develop a webpage for listing these companies and their issues
- At the top or side of the page there should be filtering controls to allow searching by Ticker Symbol or Company Name
- In the filtering controls, Users should be able to select one or more specific issues to filter the list to include
  only the companies that have exposure to that issue
- For each company, there should be an indication of *only* the issues that company has exposure to
- Each company should have a count of how many issue areas they're exposed to

### Evaluation

- Use whatever software tools, frameworks, libraries, and languages you are most comfortable with
- The page can be generated as a server side template or entirely on the frontend in JS
- The resulting page should be laid out in a clear and straightforward way for the user, but proper functionality is the
  goal, not visual design. You are welcome to use a CSS framework if you'd like, though.
- There are no expectations for how the data is to be managed: feel free to load the CSV into a database or process in
  memory
- Keep it simple!
- Your code should include a readme file with instructions on how to install any dependencies and run the code

### Submission

There's no due date, but please let us know if you'll need more than a week. When you're ready, just email back a zipped
copy of your code.
